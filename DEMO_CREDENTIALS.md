## Setup Instructions

To create these demo accounts in your Supabase database:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Click **"Add User"** for each account above
3. Enter the email and password
4. ✅ Check **"Auto Confirm User"** (so they don't need email verification)

6. Run the SQL from `create-demo-accounts.sql`

This will:
- Set correct roles for each user
- Add sample data (dog, legal agreements) for the demo client
